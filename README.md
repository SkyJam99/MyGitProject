# MyGitProject
Repository for Group Assignment in Computer Concepts Class

# Deliverables:

Submit a PDF report that contains:

-          The GitHub repository link,

-          The project members’ name,

-          The problem definition,

-          The ReadMe file (just copy and paste the content of the file)

-          A screenshot of the “commits” history of the project.  

-          A screenshot of the final content of the shared repo. (that should be the same) in each GitHub desktop app.

Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to provide you with experience in collaborative coding using basic GitHub operations. You will work in groups to plan, develop, and collaborate on a basic Python problem-solving project using version control and GitHub features.

Instructions:

1. Group Formation:

The groups have been created on Acorn. Please email me if you need any clarifications on this.

2. Project Selection:

This is not a coding assignment so you can choose any basic Python coding problem to solve. You can use assignments or Lab questions from previous classes. You should have at least two different python files + a ReadMe file. The goal is to have enough tasks for collaboration on GitHub.

3. Define Roles:

Assign roles to group members. Each role should have specific responsibilities within the project. every member should have a piece of code to write.

4. GitHub Repository Setup:

Create a new GitHub repository for your Python project, name it “MyGitProject”. Decide on the repository structure, including branches. For this project you can use the ReadMe file to write your project details and description.

5. Coding Tasks:

Identify specific coding tasks for the project. Divide the problem into smaller parts and assign these parts to different group members. Each member will be responsible for coding their assigned task.

6. Version Control Workflow:

Establish a basic version control workflow using GitHub. This includes creating branches for each task, making commits, and merging changes.

7. Collaborative Coding:

Each group member should contribute to the Python project by working on their assigned coding tasks. Collaborate using pull requests, code reviews, and comments to ensure high-quality code.

ReadMe file:

It should contain the role of each group member's, their contribution and code explanation.
