# MyGitProject
Repository for Group Assignment in Computer Concepts Class

# Deliverables:

Submit a PDF report that contains:

-          The GitHub repository link,

-          The project members’ name,

-          The problem definition,

-          The ReadMe file (just copy and paste the content of the file)

-          A screenshot of the “commits” history of the project.  

-          A screenshot of the final content of the shared repo. (that should be the same) in each GitHub desktop app.

Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to provide you with experience in collaborative coding using basic GitHub operations. You will work in groups to plan, develop, and collaborate on a basic Python problem-solving project using version control and GitHub features.

Instructions:

1. Group Formation: (COMPLETED)

2. Project Selection: (COMPLETED)

Problem: Create an application that allows the user to run several different math functions (factorial, multiplication, etc.)

Python File 1: Contains functions for each math operation

Python File 2: Allows the user to select a math operation, calls the function in the other file, and returns result to the user

3. Define Roles: (IN PROGRESS)

Task List (x means task selected):

x Create basic outline of both files

File 1
- x multiplication function
- addition function
- subtraction function
- division function
- Add comments

File 2
- Get user input (a, b, operator)
- x Use if / elif statement based on operator to call relevant function in File 1
- print out result to user (a, operator, b, =, answer)
- Add comments

x Compile and submit report

Riley tasks:
- Create basic outline of both files
- Compile and submit report
- Multiplication function
- Use if / elif statement based on operator to call relevant function in File 1

Sadman tasks:
- Division function
- print out result to user (a, operator, b, =, answer
- add comments
  
Pranav tasks:
- Addition function
- Subtraction function
- Get user input (a, b, operator)
  

Assign roles to group members. Each role should have specific responsibilities within the project. every member should have a piece of code to write.

4. GitHub Repository Setup: (COMPLETED)

Create a new GitHub repository for your Python project, name it “MyGitProject”. Decide on the repository structure, including branches. For this project you can use the ReadMe file to write your project details and description.

5. Coding Tasks: (IN PROGRESS)

Identify specific coding tasks for the project. Divide the problem into smaller parts and assign these parts to different group members. Each member will be responsible for coding their assigned task.

6. Version Control Workflow:

Establish a basic version control workflow using GitHub. This includes creating branches for each task, making commits, and merging changes.

7. Collaborative Coding:

Each group member should contribute to the Python project by working on their assigned coding tasks. Collaborate using pull requests, code reviews, and comments to ensure high-quality code.

ReadMe file:

It should contain the role of each group member's, their contribution and code explanation.
